## About the project

Basic IOS Calculator with React, TS, Mobx.
This a very basic project, many edge cases to be found. When you click an arithemetic function (+,-,/,*) and =  you will have the numbers temporarily disabled and change color to papaywhip just to represent a slow call to the Backend. 
Was created from scratch no boilerplate from   ```Create-react-app```
